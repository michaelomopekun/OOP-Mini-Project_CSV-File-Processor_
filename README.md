OOP Mini Project: CSV File Processor

Description:
This project demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C#. It reads data from a CSV file, processes it to create a list of Person objects, and prints the information in a formatted output. 
The project emphasizes file handling, string manipulation, and the practical implementation of data modeling using classes.

Features:
Reads and parses a CSV file containing details about people (e.g., firstname, lastname, occupation, age).
Creates a Person class to model individual records.
Validates and processes the CSV data dynamically using column headers.
Handles basic errors, such as invalid headers or malformed rows.
Outputs a formatted summary of the data to the console.
